                <p className="mb-8 mt-6 max-lg:text-sm leading-6 text-justify text-base text-zinc-700 font-montserrat">
                We founded freelance ethiopia in march, 2018. We were looking for freelancers and employees for our other businesses and there was no platform which enabled us to do so. In the spirit of being part of the solution, we decided to create our own job posting platform. What started out as just a job posting platform now has grown into a big ecosystem where people make consistent money through our platform. When we first entered the job market there was no affordable job posting site where the small to medium enterprises can find a competent employee for their businesses.

                Afriwork uses telegram as its main platform with over 165K subscribers, by utilizing a telegram channel and a telegram bot. The channel is where you would search for convenient and updated job posts. On the other hand, our advanced telegram bot is the medium through which you could register to the system, submit your credentials, apply for job posts, post jobs or for employers to meet with their employees. We are also developing a website and mobile application with exciting and powerful new features. The features will be developed based on the surveys/research we conduct as well as the data we analyzed so we can build a product that our target audience not only wants but needs.
